### What I learned

I learnt how to make a card and also how to make an overlay with transitions and animations.

```css
/* CARD SIX */
.card-six{
    grid-column: 2/3;
    grid-row: 5/6;    
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin-left: 30px;
    margin-top: -30px;
    width: 120%;
    padding: 30px;
    height: 140%;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.card-six-img{
    width: 90%;
    margin-top: 40px;
}

.card-six-h1{
    font-size: 3.5rem;
    margin-top: -10px;
}

.card-six-sub{
    margin-top: 15px;
    font-weight: 800;
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```


### Continued development
In the future am still going to learn more about transitions, Positioning, animations, flexbox and grid.

### Useful resources

- [Google font](https://fonts.google.com) - Google fonts really helped me with the font required for the project and also the boldness of the font.
